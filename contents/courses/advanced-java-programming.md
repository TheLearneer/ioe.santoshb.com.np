title: Advanced Java Programming
---

### Objective
To provide programming knowledge for both single system software distribution and across networks/devices and to focus on the advanced topics that a java programmer will need to know so that they will be in a position to do commercial Java development both for single services and also for distributed processes across multiple devices. To provide an in depth coverage of object serialization, Java Beans, XML, Servlets, JSP's, networking, remote objects (RMI), distributed computing, and Java database Connectivity.
